### CMPE255 Term Project - SafeDose
The degree of drug abuse has increased significantly over the past several years owing to the circumstances such as addiction, leisure, medical, and lack of knowledge pertaining to the usage of the drug. According to NIDA (The National Institute on Drug Abuse), a national research leader and information provider on substance use and addiction in the United States, many teenagers have exploited drugs at least once and recent events show an increased drug usage across all socio-economic groups. Drug abuse is life-threatening and additional research is required to identify the underlying root cause and how this misuse can be curtailed.<br> 

‘SafeDose’ is a tool driven by data science algorithms to assist in the above-identified problem. By taking a data-driven approach, we aim to identify the different kinds of substance abuse occurring in the country as well as the overcoming the challenges of lacking medical documentation that leads to failure in identifying the cause of the drug misuse episode.<br>

The solution is developed in accordance with the CRISP-DM methodology and the final outcome is presented as a web application.
